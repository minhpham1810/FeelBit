## Project Overview
FeelBit is a mood-tracking app designed to help users reflect on their emotions and gain insights into their mental well-being. With an intuitive interface, FeelBit allows users to:

### Features
1. **Track Daily Moods**  
   Select from a range of 1â€“5 expressive emojis to capture your current mood.

2. **Identify Triggers**  
   Choose up to 6 potential triggers (e.g., school, relationships, work) from a dropdown menu to explore factors influencing your emotions.

3. **Express Freely**  
   Write freely in a journaling space to elaborate on your feelings and experiences in your own words.

By combining structured inputs with open-ended journaling, FeelBit empowers users to recognize patterns, understand triggers, and take proactive steps toward improved mental wellness.
